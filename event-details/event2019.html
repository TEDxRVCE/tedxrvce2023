                  In this TEDx Talk, Mr. Piyush Goswami speaks about what makes
                  one's creative expression truly their own. He illustrates his
                  points by taking pages out of his decade long life on the road
                  that began with him taking up documentary photography and led
                  him to establish a social-work-through-art organization called
                  "Rest Of My Family"(ROMF). As a part of the organization, Mr.
                  Goswami and his team live with various remote and ignored
                  rural, tribal communities, documents their situation on the
                  ground and after careful personal experience and study
                  initiate relevant social development programs to empower these
                  communities. By taking us through his own personal journey of
                  discovering his true voice, he talks about how every artist,
                  irrespective of their subjective field, can go about
                  discovering their true selves. He was acknowledged as one of
                  the Heroes of Philanthropy in 2018 by Forbes India.
