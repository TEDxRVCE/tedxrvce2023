of Marketing at ThoughtWorks India, but also the co-founder of Your Philanthropy Story: a
platform to showcase and highlight innovative and inspiring stories of philanthropy, in an
engaging storytelling format. This initiative was created to tell the tales of large-hearted
humanitarians from all across the country, who have made it their purpose to give back to
the community; and who give their best efforts to change the world, one step at a time.
With the same altruism, she is also a co-trustee at Belakoo Trust, which conducts free bimonthly classes in Hangrapura, a village in the Malavalli taluk/Mandya district, through
volunteers. Her exemplary marketing career has strongly reinforced her efforts in
philanthropy, as her trust has grown to accommodate over 90% of the village’s student
population in the 2.5 years since its establishment

                                Born and raised in Perth, Western Australia, Christopher Gurusamy’s love and passion for
dance led him to the world renowned Kalakshetra institute in Chennai, where he is now
based out of. As a Bharatanatyam soloist, he has performed extensively within India and
across the world and is one of the frontliners of his generation of dancers. He has also
received critical acclaim including a feature in the “Best Dance of 2017” in the New York
Times. Christopher is an emblem of Bharatanatyam evolving with time and a representative
of it in the 21st century. While adhering to the grammar of the style, his aesthetics and open
creativity allows him to bring forth fresh perspective and interpretation to what is a true
representation of the new traditions of old.
