Over the years Architectural design and development have embraced a more eco-friendly
approach as a way to counter the adverse effects of Global warming, with ecologically
friendly and sustainable designs now being considered the new modern. However, there are
a few who have been advocating such design philosophies for decades now and Michael
Pearce is one such pioneer. His work has always focused on the development of buildings
which have low maintenance, low capital and running costs and renewable energy systems
of environmental control, thereby embracing the approach to balance both the natural as
well as the social and the economic environments in which the project is sited. His work can
be seen in many corners of the globe, from building in remote parts of Central Africa to
converting old buildings in North-East England and large-scale city developments in
Zimbabwe, an ecological exhibition center in Belgium, and the CH2 council office block in
Melbourne, Australia.
