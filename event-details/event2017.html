                  At the age of just 17, Tanvi Jagadish is the only female
                  surfer and stand-up paddler to have represented India.
                  Stand-Up Paddling is a fledgling sport in India, and one that
                  girls are wary of pursuing, for fear of social disapproval.
                  Tanvi mastered this sport at Mantra Surfing Club in Mangalore,
                  India, and her efforts have earned her not just several
                  national medals, but also a steadily increasing number of
                  accolades on the international platform. She claimed the top
                  prize in her first competitive Stand-Up Paddling event, the
                  2015 Covelong Point Surf Classic and clinched the same title
                  is a couple of other competitions as well. She is deeply
                  committed to making this sport popular and more accessible in
                  India, with the limelight on empowering girls and women to
                  follow their dreams.

                  Author of the bestseller, "Theory of Inner Voices", Varun
                  Thirtha is an orator, a sportsman, a theater artist, but the
                  role that has the deepest place in his heart, is that of a
                  social activist who believes that change is not just a
                  phenomenon, but a way of life. Keenly observant of unjust
                  social ostracization of people, based on gender, race and
                  sexual orientation, Varun is promoting a sense of
                  inclusiveness for all through his unique initiatives that
                  involve drama, art and dance. 'Advaita', one such initiative
                  of his, has started interview training, employment
                  opportunities, and social media platforms for transgenders.
                  But what truly sets him apart is his perpetual message that
                  each one of us can shatter the walls that separate us, with
                  simple, yet powerful weapons such as our own talents.

                  A fitness enthusiast and former professional basketball player
                  Rishabh Telang, is the cofounder of Cult, a unique fitness
                  studio chain in Bangalore that promulgates the idea of fitness
                  without machines. Telang moved to India’s Silicon Valley,
                  Bangalore, seven years ago to work for an IT giant. As part of
                  his job in the software industry, the 32-year-old from Agra,
                  Uttar Pradesh, got to travel around the world. He trained with
                  some of the world’s best coaches in Finland and the
                  Netherlands. Rishabh brought that kind of fitness culture and
                  expertise to India and became a fitness coach. With energetic
                  50-minute sessions of strength & conditioning exercises, mixed
                  martial arts, yoga, zumba, or boxing—no treadmills and no
                  other machines, Rishabh is redefining fitness. His philosophy
                  of fitness perpetuates the message that movement is life, and
                  we ought to test the limits of our strength everyday.

                  Simran Oberoi is an entrepreneur, an individual who bakes for
                  fun, happiness and cares a lot for the canines too. As an
                  ardent supporter of the vegan lifestyle, she seeks to exclude,
                  as far as possible, all forms of exploitation against animals
                  for food, clothing or any other purpose. Simran is the founder
                  of Ovenderful, a social enterprise which makes healthy,
                  organic bakes that are free from preservatives, harmful
                  additives and colours. Her vegan bakery delivers gluten-free,
                  dairy-free, sugar-free, zero fat, lactation-friendly baked
                  goodies in Bangalore, India. Simran has a simplistic approach
                  to veganism, and she believes that veganism as a diet is no
                  inferior to another; nor is it expensive and bland as it is
                  made out to be.
